# Pre-course challenges.

After you went through the pre-course we encourage you to solve these challenges. 

It's ok if you can only solve some of them, but try to do as much as possible. 

Please send your solutions to George via Slack 

or 

If you are familiar with git fork this repo (click Fork button in the top right corner to copy this repo into your account) clone them and then push back to GitHub. If your repo is private please give access to gk3000

Thanks!
